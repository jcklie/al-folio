Hi! I am Jan, I hold a doctoral degree from the [Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing]((https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp)) [(UKP) Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp), Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany. [My research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H_SmU_IAAAAJ&hl=en) focuses on data annotation, especially improving annotation efficiency for NLP. As part of the [INCEpTION project](https://inception-project.github.io/), we built a batteries-included platform for text annotation. 

I also am an experienced software engineer, especially in backend development as well as a system architect and administrator. In my free time, I love to learn Mandarin. My research interests revolve around:

- Data Annotation
- Interactive Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Continual Learning
- Information Retrieval
- Large Language Models
